# Overview

Web application to manage the list of patients in a clinic. This application is created using Python Django.

> Using a framework can reduce the time it takes to create web content. In the case of Django, you also have the benefit of using the Python programming language to process requests. When a request is made to this web app, the Django framework calls the appropriate Python code. The Python code then parse the request and prepare a response by reading a database. To produce the response, a template HTML file is populated with data created by the Python function. The response is then automatically sent back by the Django framework. 


## Guidance

* Django useful commands:
  - Create the initial project files: `django-admin startproject my_project_name`
